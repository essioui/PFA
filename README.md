## 📜 Project Overview

This project is a restaurant website built using the **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The goal of the website is to allow customers to place their orders through a client interface and for the admin to manage the orders. The system is designed to eliminate the need for a traditional server-side backend for handling orders. Instead, the client can interact with the interface, and the admin can manage order statuses (e.g., Pending, Ready).

- **Client Interface:** Customers can browse the menu, select items, and place orders.
- **Admin Interface:** The admin can view the orders, check their status, and mark them as ready for delivery.


### ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
